# **Super_Bowl_Prediction_2018**
The goal of this project is to predict the final result for super bowl based on the 2018 games. Please see the dataset I used [here](https://github.com/Yiting2018/Super_Bowl_Prediction_2018/blob/gh-pages/docs/NFL%2B2018%2BSeason%2BData.xlsx).

To build the Linear Regression Model, I used the variables of Opponent,	Game Location, Team_Score, Opponent_Score, Team_Passing, Team_Rushing, Total Team Yards, Team_Turnovers, Opponent_Passing, Opponent_Rushing, Total Opponent Yards and Opponent_Turnovers.

By looking at the graph, they do have some correlations among some of the variables.

The funny thing is **I don't really understand this sport, but I can still build a model to predict the result**, even though my predition was proved wrong lol. I guess this is the beauty of the competition.

## Code
Please see the [Jupyter Notebook](https://yiting2018.github.io/NFL_Prediction.html) for details.
